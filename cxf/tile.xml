			<!-- OLD
				These jars are outputs of the Apache build, but they are not part of 
				the cxf parent pom. They are taken from the cxf distribution pom. In general, 
				we are only including artifacts which match the cxf version. This rules out 
				some tools and dependencies that are in the distribution but not included 
				here.
				
				With cxf 3.3.4 many of these are now in the cxf parent bom and no longer
				need to be explicitly added here.
